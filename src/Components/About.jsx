                            My journey in software development commenced several
                            years ago with the completion of a basic programming
                            and web development course at the University. This
                            training enabled me to develop applications for my
                            —Åourse projects at the university. Subsequently,
                            after obtaining a degree in Civil Engineering, I
                            pursued a career in Construction Management and
                            Civil Engineering.

                            During the recent pandemic quarantine, I became
                            immersed in learning programming. I was enthused and
                            quickly gravitated towards web development, which
                            led me to develop an application to meet my specific
                            needs. I realized that my newly acquired skills
                            could be utilized in the development of cutting-edge
                            applications and technologies. My passion for
                            learning new technologies was further fueled by
                            completing online courses, enabling me to pick up
                            new tech stacks and develop unique web applications.

                            Currently, I am actively seeking opportunities that
                            will enable me to leverage my knowledge, skills, and
                            experience in software development. I am confident
                            that I can make valuable contributions to project
                            development and related tasks in software
                            development. I am comfortable working with both
                            internal and external customers and can work
                            independently or as part of a team.
